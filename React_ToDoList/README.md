# TaskFlow - A Modern To-Do List App

The **TaskFlow - A Modern To-Do List App** is a simple and interactive task management application built using **React.js, JavaScript (ES6), HTML, and CSS**. It allows users to dynamically add and manage tasks with a seamless UI experience. The app leverages **Reactâ€™s state management** for real-time updates and ensures a smooth workflow by automatically clearing input fields after adding tasks. With a **modular component-based structure**, it is designed for scalability and easy customization. Future enhancements include **task deletion, local storage integration, and a completion tracking system** for improved functionality. The App is deployed using Vercel.

## Project Structure  
```
React_ToDoList
â”‚â”€â”€ public
â”‚â”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx        # Main React component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js          # Renders the app
â”‚â”€â”€ package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md            # Documentation
```


## How It Works  
1. The app maintains two state variables:  
   - `inputText` â†’ Stores the text entered by the user.  
   - `items` â†’ Stores the list of tasks.  
2. When the user types in the input field, the `handleChange` function updates the `inputText` state.  
3. When the **Add** button is clicked:  
   - The `addItem` function updates the `items` state by adding the new task.  
   - The input field is cleared for new entries.  
4. The app dynamically renders all tasks as a list using the `.map()` method.  


## Future Improvements  
ðŸ”¹ Add a **delete** button to remove tasks  
ðŸ”¹ Implement **local storage** to save tasks after refreshing  
ðŸ”¹ Add **checkboxes** to mark tasks as completed
