CineScope - The Ultimate Movie Explorer
Overview
CineScope is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that allows users to explore movies, search for films, and manage a list of favorites. It leverages The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch movie data, including posters, titles, and release dates. The app features dynamic routing, state management with React Context, and persistent storage for user favorites using localStorage.
